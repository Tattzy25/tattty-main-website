## Summary of Changes

Phase 1 has been **fully implemented** with all required features for Card 8 completion. The questionnaire flow has been reduced from 9 cards to 8 cards, and Card 8 now includes AI-powered personalization, image upload functionality, and a distinctive "Build" button.

---

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. **Reduced Total Cards from 9 to 8**
- ✅ Updated state arrays from `cardData.length + 3` to `cardData.length + 2`
- ✅ Updated `handleSkip()` function to use 8 total cards
- ✅ Updated `handleNext()` function to use 8 total cards
- ✅ Removed old static `card8Data` definition
- ✅ Added dynamic Card 8 data generation

**Files Modified:**
- `app/inked/page.tsx` - Lines 195-200, 318-335, 338-363

---

### 2. **AI Follow-up Question Logic**
- ✅ Created `generateAIFollowUpQuestion()` function with smart logic
- ✅ Analyzes user responses from Cards 1-7
- ✅ Detects skipped questions (3+ skipped)
- ✅ Personalizes questions based on first response keywords:
  - Family-related responses
  - Vehicle-related responses  
  - Place/location-related responses
  - Generic emotional significance fallback
- ✅ Dynamic Card 8 data uses AI-generated question as subtitle
- ✅ useEffect hook triggers question generation when user reaches Card 8

**Files Modified:**
- `app/inked/page.tsx` - Lines 237-282

**Example AI Questions Generated:**
```
// If user skipped 3+ questions:
"I noticed you skipped a few questions. Is there anything specific about 
your story or vision that you'd like to share before we create your design?"

// If first response mentions family:
"Family seems important to you. Is there a specific memory or moment with 
them that you want captured in this design?"

// If first response mentions vehicles:
"That vehicle sounds special. What makes it more than just transportation to you?"

// If first response mentions places:
"Places hold powerful memories. What's the feeling you get when you think 
about that location?"

// Default fallback:
"Before we create your design, is there any emotional significance or hidden 
meaning you want woven into the artwork?"
```
