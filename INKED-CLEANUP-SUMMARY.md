# INKED PAGE CLEANUP - NO FALLBACKS, FRIENDLY ERRORS

## ✅ COMPLETED CHANGES

### 1. **Removed ALL Fallbacks**
- ❌ Removed `return basicPrompt` fallback in `tattoo-prompt/route.ts`
- ❌ All errors now THROW instead of falling back
- ✅ If AI fails, user sees friendly error + retry option

### 2. **Fixed Image Count: 4 → 2**
- Changed from "4 unique designs" to "2 unique designs"
- Added validation: Must be exactly 1 color + 1 stencil
- System will THROW error if wrong count/types returned

### 3. **User-Friendly Error System**
- **Created**: `lib/error-logging.ts`
  - Logs all technical errors to console
  - Converts to friendly messages for users
  - NO technical jargon shown to users
  
- **Updated**: `components/error-popup.tsx`
  - Beautiful, non-scary UI
  - Shows friendly message only
  - "Try Again" button (max 1 retry)
  - After 1 retry: Shows "Please refresh or contact support"

### 4. **Retry Logic (Max 1 Attempt)**
- User gets ONE retry per error
- After 1 retry fails: Must refresh page
- Retry button disappears after 1 use
- All retry state tracked properly

### 5. **Error Handling Enhanced**
- **Generation errors**: Caught and logged with context
- **Loading errors**: Friendly popup with retry
- **API errors**: NO fallbacks, errors bubble up
- **Validation errors**: Check image count/types

### 6. **Error Messages**
Technical (logged to console):
```

## 🎯 VALIDATION RULES

### Image Generation Must Return:

## 🔒 NO FALLBACKS GUARANTEE

Every function that could fail now:
1. ✅ Throws error (doesn't return fallback)
2. ✅ Logs error with context
3. ✅ Shows user-friendly message
4. ✅ Provides retry option (max 1)

**NO MORE SILENT FAILURES!**
